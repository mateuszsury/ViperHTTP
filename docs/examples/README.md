# ViperHTTP Examples

- `01_minimal.py`: minimal app, automatic runtime + docs bootstrap.
- `02_router_and_depends.py`: router grouping + dependency injection + typed query params.
- `03_middleware_and_exceptions.py`: middleware and custom exception handlers.
- `04_websocket_and_stream.py`: WebSocket echo and chunked streaming response.
- `05_https_http2.py`: HTTPS + HTTP/2 startup with certificate paths.

All examples are ViperHTTP-native and FastAPI-style in usage, without manual bridge startup.
